summary: We present the first fully atomistic multiscale method (QM/uFQFμ) to model surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) of molecules near plasmonic nanostructures. By coupling quantum mechanics with an atomistic electrodynamical model, the approach captures how nanoparticle morphology, defects, and atomistic features control fluorescence quenching and enhancement.
abstract: | 
  The fluorescence response of a chromophore in the proximity of a plasmonic nanostructure can be
  enhanced by several orders of magnitude, yielding the so-called surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF).
  An in-depth understanding of SEF mechanisms benefits from fully atomistic theoretical models because
  SEF signals can be non-trivially affected by the atomistic profile of the nanostructure's surface. This work
  presents the first fully atomistic multiscale approach to SEF, capable of describing realistic structures.
  The method is based on coupling density functional theory (DFT) with state-of-the-art atomistic
  electromagnetic approaches, allowing for reliable physically-based modeling of molecule–nanostructure
  interactions. Computed results remarkably demonstrate the key role of the NP morphology and
  atomistic features in quenching/enhancing the fluorescence signal.
