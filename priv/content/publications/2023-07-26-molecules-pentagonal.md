summary: We analyze the time evolution of plasmonic excitations in pentagonal silver clusters (Ag25+, Ag43+) using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and real-time descriptors. Transition contribution maps and induced densities reveal distinct plasmon-like collective responses for longitudinal excitations and molecular-like transitions for transverse ones, with a characteristic delay of the plasmon signal relative to the driving pulse.

  In the present work, we apply recently developed real-time descriptors to study the time evolution of plasmonic features of pentagonal Ag clusters. The method is based on the propagation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation within a singly excited TDDFT ansatz. We use transition contribution maps (TCMs) and induced density to characterize the optical longitudinal and transverse response of such clusters, when interacting with pulses resonant with the low-energy (around 2–3 eV, A1) size-dependent or the high-energy around 4 eV, E1) size-independent peak. TCMs plots on the analyzed clusters, Ag+25 and Ag+43 show off-diagonal peaks consistent with a plasmonic response when a longitudinal pulse resonant at A1 frequency is applied, and dominant diagonal spots, typical of a molecular transition, when a transverse E1 pulse is employed. Induced densities confirm this behavior, with a dipole-like charge distribution in the first case. The optical features show a time delay with respect to the evolution of the external pulse, consistent with those found in the literature for real-time TDDFT calculations on metal clusters.
