summary: Using molecular dynamics, we screened zeolite frameworks for the selective separation of sucrose and 6-kestose in aqueous solution. Among 253 candidates, three extra-large pore zeolites (AET, DON, ETR) were studied in detail. Simulations show that while all three favor sucrose uptake, DON exhibits the highest selectivity and flux, making it a strong candidate for oligosaccharide purification.

  Extra-large pore zeolites are a small subset (21) among the whole list of 253 zeolites available. The discovery of
  new low-glycemic sugars is very attractive as new healthy additives in the food field. This is the case of the 6-
  kestose. In the present case, it appears in a mixture in aqueous solution together with sucrose, the separation of
  the mixture being necessary. For this, we have focused on using certain zeolites with adequate pore sizes that
  allow the separation of this mixture, considering that since the molecular size of 6-kestose is greater than sucrose,
  it is necessary to promote the sorption of the latter, so that the first can be purified. After a computational
  screening of micropores of the 253 IZA zeolites, 11 zeolites were selected. Of these, 3 extra-large pore zeolites
  (AET, DON, ETR) have been proposed, which were analyzed in-depth through a molecular dynamics study
  considering the external surface. The results show that DON presents the most promising theoretical results for a
  selective sucrose/6-kestose separation.
