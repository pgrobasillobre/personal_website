summary: We introduce a hybrid multiscale method (ωFQFμ-BEM) that models metal nanoparticles with an implicit continuum core and atomistic surface. Coupled with quantum mechanics, this framework reproduces optical properties and Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) with high accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of fully atomistic approaches

  A multiscale QM/classical approach is presented, that is able to model the optical
  properties of complex nanostructures composed of a molecular system adsorbed on
  metal nanoparticles. The latter are described by a combined atomistic–continuum
  model, where the core is described using the implicit boundary element method (BEM)
  and the surface retains a fully atomistic picture and is treated employing the
  frequency-dependent fluctuating charge and fluctuating dipole (ωFQFμ) approach.

  The integrated QM/ωFQFμ-BEM model is numerically compared with state-of-the-art
  fully atomistic approaches, and the quality of the continuum/core partition is
  evaluated. The method is then extended to compute Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering
  (SERS) within a Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) framework.
