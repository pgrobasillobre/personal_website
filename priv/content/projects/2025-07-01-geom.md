## Features

- **AI Assistant for nanoparticle and graphene creation** *(new in v1.1.0)*
- **Geometry Transformations**: Translation, rotation, merging, and specular (mirror) transformations.
- **Nanoparticle Generation**: Sphere, rod, core-shell, tip, pyramid, cone, icosahedron, and more.
- **Graphene Structures**: Ribbons, disks, rings, and triangles.
- **Advanced Options**: Alloying, dimer formation, and bowtie configurations.
- **Minimum Distance Calculation** between XYZ geometries.
- **Geometrical Center Computation**.


## Use Examples

After installation, load the GEOM environment by running:

```
geom_load
```

This will set the necessary aliases and environment variables to run the tool properly.

Once the environment is set up, run the following command to see the available options:

```
geom -h
```

This will display the help menu with all the available commands and their descriptions.

Example commands:

- **Rotate geometry 90 degrees** around the Y-axis:

```
geom -r1 90 geom.xyz origin_CM_yes +y
```

- Generate a nanoparticle sphere:

```
geom -create -sphere Ag 30
```

- Generate a graphene ribbon: 

```
geom -create -graphene rib 50 20
```

## Starting the AI Assistant *(new in v1.1.0)*

GEOM now includes an **AI-powered assistant** that understands natural language, translates it into valid GEOM CLI commands, and executes them automatically.

This assistant is built using [Microsoft's AutoGen framework](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), which enables a multi-agent system to interface with OpenAI’s language models and run commands dynamically.

### 1. Export your OpenAI API key

The assistant requires access to **OpenAI's LLMs**. Make sure you have your API key set:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

> You can obtain an API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

### 2. Start the assistant

To launch the chat-based assistant, load the GEOM environment (i.e., with `geom_load`) and run:

```
ai_geom
```

You’ll be greeted with a chat prompt where you can type requests like:


```
Create a gold nanorod along the z axis that is 40 angstroms long and 10 angstroms wide.
```

The assistant will automatically create and execute the corresponding GEOM command for you.
