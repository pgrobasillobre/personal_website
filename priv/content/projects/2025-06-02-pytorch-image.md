title: Pytorch Image Colorizer
summary: PyTorch-based implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic image colorization using a U-Net architecture. The model is trained to convert grayscale images into RGB using the STL-10 dataset, which contains natural images at a resolution of 96Ã—96 pixels.
