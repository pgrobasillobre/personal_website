## Problem
Model FRET observables efficiently in large systems without sacrificing physical correctness, and integrate with existing QM/MM pipelines.

## Approach
- C++ core with Fortran routines where mature kernels exist.
- Parallelism via OpenMP; attention to cache locality and false sharing.
- Deterministic pipelines (seeded), structured logging, and small golden tests.

## Outcome
- End-to-end runs for medium systems complete in minutes on a laptop.
- Hot loops vectorized; reduced memory traffic; stable performance across inputs.

## Features
- CLI: `fretlab run config.yaml` for batch studies.
- Library API for embedding in Python workflows.
- Simple file formats for inputs/outputs; CSV summaries.

## Build (example)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
