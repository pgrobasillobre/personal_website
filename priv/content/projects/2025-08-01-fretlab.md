title: FretLab
summary: Toolkit for modeling Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in full QM and QM/MM workflows, available in both C++ and Fortran versions with fast, parallel execution.
impact: Improved performance over other available open-source tools through software refinement and OpenMP parallelization. Two independent implementations (C++ and Fortran) are available to support different integration needs.

## About

**FretLab** is a high-performance computational tool designed to compute **electronic energy transfer (EET) rates**. It supports three general use cases:

1. **Donor to acceptor chromophore EET**
2. **Plasmonic substrate to acceptor chromophore EET**
3. **Donor to acceptor chromophore EET mediated by a plasmonic substrate**

FretLab is designed for speed and scalability using parallel processing with OpenMP and efficient linear algebra routines.


## Theoretical Framework

All quantities in FretLab are expressed in atomic units. The EET rate is 
calculated using Fermi’s Golden Rule:

$$
\kappa_{\text{EET}} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \ |V|^2 \ J
$$

Where:
- V is the total coupling potential between donor and acceptor
- J is the [spectral overlap integral](https://github.com/pgrobasillobre/SpectralOverlap)

In the presence of a plasmonic substrate (modeled via induced charges $q_k$ and, if applicable, induced dipoles $\mu_k$), the total coupling V becomes:




```math
V = V_{\mathrm{coulomb}} + V_{\mathrm{overlap}} + V_{\mathrm{environment}}^{q} + V_{\mathrm{environment}}^{\mu}
```

$$
V_{\text{coulomb}} =  \int d\mathbf{r} \ d\mathbf{r'} \ \frac{\rho_A^*(\mathbf{r}) \rho_D(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|}
$$

$$
V_{\text{overlap}} = - \omega_0 \int d\mathbf{r} \ d\mathbf{r'} \ \rho_A^*(\mathbf{r}) \rho_D (\mathbf{r'}) 
$$

$$
V_{\text{environment}}^{\text{   q}} = \sum_k \left( \int d\mathbf{r} \ \frac{\rho_A^*(\mathbf{r})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_k|} \right) q^\omega(\mathbf{r}_k; \rho_D)
$$


$$
V_{\text{environment}}^{\mu} = \sum_k \left( \int d\mathbf{r} \ -\frac{\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_k}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_k|^3} \cdot \rho_A^*(\mathbf{r}) \right) \mu^\omega(\mathbf{r}_k; \rho_D)
$$

Where:

- $\rho_A$ and $\rho_D$ are the acceptor and donor charge densities  
- $\omega_0$ is the incident frequency  
- $q_k^\omega(\mathbf{r}_k; \rho_D)$ are the frequency-dependent induced charges at positions $\mathbf{r}_k$
- $\mu_k^\omega(\mathbf{r}_k; \rho_D)$ are the frequency-dependent induced dipoles at positions $\mathbf{r}_k$
