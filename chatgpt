Love it—here’s a simple, personal, and recruiter-friendly plan you can build in Phoenix step by step (no DB, all content as files for now).

Site structure (what to include)

Home (root): your story + value prop, quick CTAs, and fresh “what I’m doing now.”

Software / Projects: 4–6 flagship projects with “problem → approach → impact” and links.

Case Studies: short, narrative outcomes (1–2 paragraphs each). This is what hiring managers actually read.

Publications (curated): 3–6 with plain-English summaries and your role.

Lab Notebook (micro-notes): bite-size posts (bug you fixed, profiling trick, paper takeaway).

Now: 3 bullets updated monthly—what you’re learning/building/reading.

About (personal): why you mix chemistry + software; how you like to work; a friendly photo.

Contact: clear “open to roles” line + email/GitHub/LinkedIn/ORCID/Scholar.

(Optional later) Talks/Teaching, Uses/Colophon, Interactive Demos (e.g., molecule viewer).

Implementation approach (keep it lightweight)

Phoenix + LiveView, no DB.

Markdown content in priv/content/ with front matter (title, date, tags, summary, impact, links).

blog/ (lab notes), projects/, cases/, publications/, now.yml.

Reusable components: Card, Tag, Metric, Timeline, “Link row” for CTAs.

Visual tone: minimal Tailwind, one accent color, headshot, multilingual greeting line.

Root page (home) layout

Hero (personal + clear):

One-liner: “Computational chemist building high-performance scientific software.”

Two buttons: Download CV and Contact.

Small facts row: Pisa · Remote-friendly · Python/C++/Fortran · Open to roles.

“Now” strip: 3 bullets pulled from now.yml (auto-updates the homepage when you update one file).

Highlights (3 cards): your strongest project, one case study, one publication—each with a single impact metric (e.g., “12× speedup,” “reduced memory 40%”).

Recent writing: last 3 Lab Notebook notes (titles + 1-line takeaway).

Trust signals: current affiliation/collaborations (logos or text), links to Scholar/ORCID.

Final CTA: “Work with me / Hire me” → Contact page.

Why this works

Personal voice up front, but outcomes and links are easy to scan for recruiters.

You can ship it incrementally: Home → Software → Publications → Notes, then add Case Studies and Demos later.

No backend complexity; everything is just markdown files + LiveView pages.

If you like this, I’ll map these sections to concrete routes and the exact content file schema (front-matter fields) next.
